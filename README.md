# 2DMonsterGame
CS Capstone group project. Navigate a monster-infested maze.

This project is a 2D game built in C++ using the SFML 2D graphics library. Our group decided to select this language since we have experience with it from our coursework.

To launch the program, simply enter "make" into the WSL terminal. Ensure you have the SFML 2D graphics library installed for WSL.
