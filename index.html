        <p>CS Capstone Spring 2024 group project. Navigate a monster-infested maze.</p>
        <p>This project is a 2D game built in C++ using the SFML 2D graphics library. Our group decided to select this
            language since we have experience with it from our coursework.</p>

        <h2>Contributions</h2>
        <p>Maintainence and Contribution: Anton and Michael have contributed to this project, and it may be maintained
            and updated going forward.</p>
        <p>1. Clone the github project and switch branches to combine, using in the terminal "git checkout combine"</p>
        <p>2. To launch the program, simply enter "make" into the WSL terminal. Ensure you have the SFML 2D graphics
            library installed for WSL.
            What the make file does: All .cpp files are compiled with C++17 into an executable called "prog".</p>
        <p>3. You will need the development library called: <b>libsfml-dev</b> Then, install the library:
            <b>sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev</b>

            If it prompts you, enter <b>yes</b> to install.

            Here is the official SFML tutorial for Linux with some sample code for testing:
            <b> https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.6/start-linux.php</b>

            Then you can run <b>"make"</b>
        </p>

                <img src="slime1.png" alt="2D Monster Maze image" class="image-used">
                <p>Use the WASD keys to move around, and the C and V keys to rotate the player.</p>
                <p>Use the F keys to fire the weapon.

                    The player has 3 lives. Once they are all exhausted, the game is lost.</p>
            </li>

                <p>Power ups spawn in scattered across the map. Collide with them to collect them.</p>
                <p>These power ups can alter statistics like the weapon's rate of fire and the player's rate of speed.
                </p>
                <p>Red Speed Boost powerup -> increases the speed of the player</p>
                <p>Green Single Fire Rate powerup -> Changes the Mode of the firemode of lasers</p>
                <p>Blue Double Score powerup -> doubles the score of killing an enemy</p>
